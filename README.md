# ElevatorProblem
Download the application
When the Maven project is downloaded and built, elevator-jar-with-dependencies.jar is installed in the elevatorsample/target directory.
In the command prompt, the command to run the project is java -jar elevator-jar-with-dependencies.jar <input.txt> <mode>
For example: java -jar elevator-jar-with-dependencies.jar c:\\test\\input.txt 
Thank you.
